### Feedback for Submission: `match_stats_job.py`

Hello, and thank you for submitting your Apache Spark Infrastructure assignment. Let me provide feedback regarding your implementation and adherence to best practices.

#### Task 1: Disable default behavior of broadcast joins
- **Implementation**: You have correctly disabled the automatic broadcast join by setting `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` to `-1`.
- **Feedback**: Good job on correctly configuring this setting in the Spark session builder.

#### Task 2: Explicitly broadcast join the `medals` and `maps` tables
- **Implementation**: You correctly used `broadcast` in the `broadcast_join_maps` and `broadcast_join_medals` functions.
- **Feedback**: Nicely done. You’ve demonstrated an understanding of broadcasting for specific joins, which enforces better optimization.

#### Task 3: Bucket join on `match_id` with 16 buckets
- **Implementation**: You correctly partition and bucket the datasets using `bucketBy`, `repartition`, and `sortWithinPartitions`, then join the bucketed data.
- **Feedback**: It’s clear that you understand the importance of partitioning and bucketing, which is crucial for performance optimization. You correctly saved and re-read the bucketed tables.

#### Task 4: Aggregate to answer questions
- **Implementation**: You have provided implementations to determine player stats and map usage.
- **Feedback**: 
  - **Query 4a**: The average kills per game calculation lacks aggregation over total matches per player. You should compute `avg_kills_per_game` by dividing total kills by the count of games played.
  - **Query 4b & 4c**: The query correctly identifies the most popular playlist and map.
  - **Query 4d**: You correctly filtered and computed the most common map for Killing Spree medals.

#### Task 5: Optimize data size with `.sortWithinPartitions`
- **Implementation**: You created versions of bucket tables with different sorting strategies and compared file sizes.
- **Feedback**: Excellent approach to testing `.sortWithinPartitions`. You showed understanding by exploring the impact of different sort keys.

#### Code Structure and Best Practices
- **Code Clarity**: The code is generally clean and comments are adequate for understanding the functionality.
- **Best Practices**: The use of functions to organize different parts of the process is commendable.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- **Documentation**: Consider adding more description for each function, especially detailing any assumptions or edge cases handled.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure to handle cases where datasets might be empty or columns missing, which could occur during data preprocessing.
- **Performance Considerations**: Although you’ve made good use of optimizations, always consider the cost of `.show()` on large DataFrames, which might be expensive.

### Conclusion
Overall, you've demonstrated a good grasp of the exercise requirements and Apache Spark join optimizations. There are minor improvements needed in calculating per-game averages, but these don't significantly detract from your submission's success.
